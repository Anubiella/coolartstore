# CoolArtStore

A demo project showing the minimum pieces of designing an application using Node.js as a mock platform.



This repository contains everything you need to get the demo running locally on a machine with Node already installed. If you need help installing Node, follow the instructions on [the project's site](http://nodejs.org/). After cloning this repo to your machine, you can start the server by going to the directory you cloned it to in your terminal or command line and typing

```node server.js```

To see the demo in action, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. 

To tweak and make changes, just edit the relevant files, save, and restart the server. Use ^C to stop the current execution, then `node server.js` again to restart.
